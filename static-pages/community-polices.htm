<p>These rules apply to the Discord server and Project Moondance forum unless otherwise noted. Although these rules are simple and concise, it is still important to read them carefully;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Our community platforms are designed to be a positive environment for everyone. Keep drama out of the discussions, and do not harass, slander, threaten others for any reason, or otherwise post hate speech.</li>
	<li>Do not impersonate staff members.</li>
	<li>Do not post personal information about other users without their permission.</li>
	<li>Do not post content which exceeds a “PG-13” rating, is obviously&nbsp;NSFW, or is otherwise prohibited under relevant terms of use.</li>
	<li>Do not spam or post too rapidly on the Discord server. This applies to any form of content, including messages, emojis, images, etc.</li>
	<li>Do not unduly promote other projects/Discord servers/etc. without permission, particularly if they do not involve StepMania</li>
	<li>Do not discuss potentially controversial aspects of subjects such as politics or religion.</li>
	<li>Do not post any content that violates copyrights or is otherwise illegal.</li>
	<li>Direct links to simfile downloads (defined as a clickable link), if they do not contain music that was distributed by its creator at no charge, or is otherwise licensed under terms (such as a Creative Commons licence) that explicitly grant permission for redistribution, can not be shared on any official Moondance platforms. In other words, we do not know where you can find simfiles; you should know already. We’re not gonna help unless it’s 100% legal. Links to videos showcasing simfiles are okay.</li>
	<li>Do not “beg”/ask for access to the source code for StepMania 5.3; its source code will be released under an open source license at a later date, but we are not currently doing so in order to ensure the integrity and quality of pre-release builds (ensuring that only builds vetted and tested by the development team are released to the public at this time). There are also optional non-free dependencies that we would have to remove before performing a open source code release.</li>
</ol>

<p>Moderators and development team members reserve the right to enforce these conduct policies; abuse of our platforms may result in warnings or bans from the communities.</p>
