<p>On StepMania 5.3 Alpha 4.5 and newer, we switched to using an XInput-compliant input system.</p>

<p>Due to these changes, not all controllers (such as gamepads, dance pads, and other rhythm game-specific controllers) are guaranteed to function with StepMania 5.3 out of the box (even if they were supported on earlier versions), unless a controller mapping profile has been created for that specific controller.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Josen Tiamat for writing these new instructions for how to configure your controllers for use on 5.3.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Things to check for first</h2>

<p>So you started up the game and boom you go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” and set up your controller, skip this guide because you’re done with what you need to do.</p>

<h3>You can’t configure your Config Key/Joy Mappings! OH NO! (I will get to this)</h3>

<p>Test your input, see if your keys are mapped and if so which ones. By pushing the buttons on the pad it’ll say something to the effect of “Key B 12 – Not Mapped” and if you step/press on the key and nothing shows up it’s not mapped, no big proceed to the next step to set it up.</p>

<h2>Step 2: The Easy Way</h2>

<p>So on to the good stuff; 5.3 has a built in gamepad tool that will automatically take care of most of this for you</p>

<p>You push “Enter” on the keyboard and push the appropriate button on the dance pad/etc. to map the buttons to the button you want.</p>

<p>I would recommend using this screen for most controllers on pc, it takes a lot of the guess work out of the whole thing. After setting this up repeat Step 1 if your keys show up as “Unmapped” that’s great go to the “Config Key/Joy Mappings” and do your thing, you’re done with the guide!</p>

<p>If it still doesn't work...</p>

<h2>Step 3: The not super intuitive way (SDL2 Gamepad Tool)</h2>

<p>There is a nifty tool around called <a href="http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/">SDL2 Gamepad Tool</a>. You connect your controller (via USB or Bluetooth or however you desire to connect your controller to the PC), and it’ll show up on the top drop down menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/media/controller-guide/guide_3.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block fr-fic fr-dii"></p>

<ol>
	<li>Click "Create a New Mapping"</li>
	<li>Step/Press the input you want for those buttons much like you would on Step 2 of this procedure.</li>
	<li>Skip the rest.</li>
	<li>Save the Mapping String.</li>
	<li>Copy the Mapping String.</li>
	<li>Go to where you installed StepMania, and paste the string into Data/gamecontrollerdb.txt</li>
</ol>

<h3>A note</h3>

<p><img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/media/controller-guide/guide_4.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block fr-fic fr-dii"></p>

<p>The “#” is useful for when you want to have different Mapping Strings for the same gamepad, it basically hides the mapping string from the program reading it. I made 3 different mapping for testing the the program would only recognize one, then I hid the mapping string with a hashtag (pound symbol for you oldies around) and the one not hidden was now seen by the program.</p>

<p>Basically, don’t do multiple mapping strings on the same controller (even if you change the name); the program will work with one at a time and honestly one is all you need. You should be good to go and repeat Step 1 and then go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” right after and set up your pad.</p>

<h2>Still isn't working?</h2>

<p>This hasn’t quite happened to me (I tried with the PS3 DDR mat) but there are 2 types of controllers, a “Hat” type and not. So let’s say for example you hook up a pad/controller and the Dpad you configured up down left and right but “Config Key/Joy Mappings” only allows you to push one of them and the rest don’t work.</p>

<p>Try configuring the directions to the analog stick instead and then mapping them again. I don’t think you should have to but it works, I’ve tested this with my PS4 Controller and in fact you can play with analog input.</p>
