<ul>
	<li>StepMania 5.3 is still under active development, so there will likely still be bugs and other quirks. If you encounter issues or have any comments or questions, be sure to report or discuss them on our <strong><a href="https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox/issues">GitHub for public issue tracking</a></strong>, Discord server, or forum. <strong>DO NOT REPORT BUGS FOR THESE BUILDS ON THE MAIN STEPMANIA GITHUB.</strong></li>
	<li>If upgrading from a previous build, be sure to <strong>uninstall it</strong> and delete the Appearance/Themes folder in the installation directory before installing the next build, or install it in a separate directory. In-place upgrades between versions may create conflicts that lead to issues running the game.</li>
	<li>Changes to the input system on StepMania 5.3 may impact your ability to use controllers without additional configuration. See the <strong><a href="../help/controllers">controller guide</a></strong> for more information</li>
	<li>For ARM builds, type <code>uname -a</code> at a shell to determine the correct architecture release to download.</li>
